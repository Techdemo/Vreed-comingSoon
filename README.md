Boilerplate for building static sites with goold old fashioned html and css.

## ðŸ›  Usage
- Write all your ES2015+ Javascript code in `src/js` and SCSS styling in `src/style`. Store static assets in `src/static`. Organize HTML files the way you like.
- Available commands:
  - `npm run build`: Build files to the `dist` folder. Transpiles down to ES5 and bundles all JS into `app.bundle.js`. Transpiles SCSS to CSS and adds prefixing into `style.bundle.css`. Copies static assets and HTML over, and bundled CSS and JS gets added to HTML file.
  - `npm run start:dev`: Run `webpack-dev-server` at `localhost:9000`. Includes live reloading on any Javascript/SCSS/HTML changes.
  - `npm run start`: Builds files and runs a local production server on `localhost:8080` with `http-server`.
  - `npm run run lint:js`: Lints JS with ESLint.
  - `npm run lint:styles`: Lints SCSS stylesheets with stylelint.
  - `npm run lint:html`: Lints HTML for a11y issues using pa11y.

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Integration

This boilerplate contains integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). The build system runs all linting scripts and deploys to GitHub pages upon push to the `master` branch. However, note that this deployment flow only works for Project Pages.

For more information on how to set up alternative deployment processes, check out the [Travis CI documentation on deployment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment). The service can deploy to dozens of cloud providers, including Heroku, AWS, and Firebase.
